# README

This repository contains the code and data that were used to perform the 
analysis of human scRNASeq data from patients undergoing VA-ECLS in support of 
our paper describing the presence and function of human CD4+ cells expressing 
CHAT. Using the code and data provided here, the panels of Figure 1 of that 
paper can be reproduced.

Please note that this repo contains large data files required to reproduce key
elements of the our CHAT cell analysis. If you do not have Git LFS installed,
you will only get the soft links to these files, not the files themselves, when
you clone the repo. That is fine, unless you want to reproduce the analysis (as
opposed to just reviewing the code).

Luckily, LFS support is easy to install. See here: https://git-lfs.github.com

See analysis.rmd (or its rendered equivalent, analysis.html) for details.
